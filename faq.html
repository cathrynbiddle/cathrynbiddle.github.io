            <p>First class FAQ What is GMA? Why do we bow? Why all the culture and terminology? Is there a convenient time to start classes? What opportunity is there to compete in tournaments? How do I address the instructor? What if I have rank/experience
                in martial arts coming into the class? I’ve never done martial arts before. Is that okay? Yes. Everyone starts somewhere, and we’re always happy to take newcomers. I’m not especially in shape/coordinated. Will I still get something out
                of this? Yes. The way to get into better shape is to train. Martial arts is a good place to start. What should I wear? Are uniforms required? For your first few classes, just wear comfortable clothes you can move freely in. For example,
                gym shorts and a tee shirt are great! When you’re ready to commit to the experience, we have uniforms available in our pro shop for around $25. Do I need to come to every practice? The short answer is no. As long as you come in regularly
                you’ll Can I come late/leave early? Absolutely. We are all students so we understand scheduling conflicts can occur. We’re just happy you showed up. top How much does it cost? Can I try it out first? The first 3 times you come to club
                are free, after which you must pay $40 in dues. The weeks before and during belt testing are free practice and you do not need to have paid dues to participate. top Are there classes as well? Yes. Visit the Schedule of Classes for the
                current/upcoming semester and search for SPH-I 147 for Beginning Hapkido. top How does belt testing work? Twice a semester we hold belt testing on Tuesdays and Thursdays, the exact dates are announced in club as they come closer. top Do
                I have to test? No, testing is not required. We do encourage belt testing because it helps improve your skills and allows one on one feedback from an experienced martial artist. top What is the lining-up process? The instructor will call
                for line up. All ranked belts will line up, starting from the right and ranked from high to low. Second and third rows will form as necessary. People not wearing uniforms will line up last. top ADVANCED STUDENT'S GUIDE ANSWERS TO SOME
                COMMON QUESTIONS FOR CURRENT STUDENTS I need more practice. Where can I go? You can practice while you’re cleaning your room, doing your dishes, whenever. Remember, we have practice M-Th from 5:30 to 7:30, so we have plenty of time for
                instructor-led practice. However, for those of you still craving more instructor-led practice you can go to Satori- Integrated Martial Arts, where one of our former instructors, Arlo Welty, trains. top What other arts/clubs complement
                Hapkido? Everything. Our mantra is “if it works, it’s good hapkido.” That being said, IU offers many martial arts and we recommend trying any of them to see if you like them. top Why do I pay USHF dues? What do I get for it? The United
                States Hapkido Federation (USHF) is our parent organization, and provide the club with a lot of resources. By being a USHF member, you get discounts on USHF seminars. top What’s the deal with these self-defense seminars? Can I help? Part
                of our campus involvement is teaching self-defense to other organizations at IU in hour long seminars. Any IUSDC members are more than welcome to help teach at these seminars. top Do we have other events outside of club practices? Absolutely.
                We have monthly club socials where we watch movies and eat pizza. We also participate in various philanthropic events such as the JB5k or Habitat for Humanity. And we just enjoy hanging out with each other. top Where do I go for weapons
                and gear? We have our own club store here. We also support buying weapons from Satori Training Weapons. top I’m interested in being an officer. What positions are there, and how do I run? You can read more about the officer positions on
                this page. We are a student run club and any student who would want to become an officer is invited to apply. top Can I assist with the IU Hapkido classes? Yes. Many of our advanced students will AI for the hapkido and self-defense classes.
                The process for doing this is to talk to the instructor of the class and confirm that you can help, then filling out a form to register for SPH-K 485. top Where can I find belt sheets? Belt sheets can be found right here. top What’s this
                “Kunja” thing I keep hearing about? Coming Soon
