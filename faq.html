                    <a class="clickMe">What is GMA?</a>
                    <p> GMA is a premiere martial arts academy located in Martinsville, IN.

                    <a class="clickMe">Why do we bow?</a>
                    <p> Bowing is not only tradition, it is a valuable way for students to display respect for the space, their classmates and training partners, the instructor, and the time spent training.
                    </p>

                    <a class="clickMe"> Why all the culture and terminology?</a>
                    <p> Martial arts is more than physical- traditional arts have a rich history and philosophy that benefit the student's mind. Training the body without training the mind is a job half done.

                    <p> Fortunately our classes are year round and based on rank. That means you can and should start at any time, and as you progress your class will progress with you.

                    <p>GMA makes a point to promote tournament opportunities for our students without being a "tournament school" ourselves. We have many students who never miss a tournament and many students who have never been to a tournament. If you do
                        choose to compete, you will always have the full support of the school and community backing you.

                    <a class="clickMe">How do I address the instructor? </a>
                    <p>Instructors should be addressed by their title, which is "Master", followed by their last name. If they ask you a yes/no question, you should respond yes/no sir.

                    <p> Yes. The way to get into better shape is to train. Martial arts is a good place to start.

                    <p> For your first few classes, just wear comfortable clothes you can move freely in. For example, gym shorts and a tee shirt are great! When you're ready to commit to the experience, we have uniforms available in our pro shop for around
                        $25.

                    <a class="clickMe">Do I need to come to every practice?</a>
                    <p>Students are encouraged to attend two classes per week. Your body needs to practice what it has learned before it is ready to learn more, and two classes per week is a comfortable pace for most students. If you need to miss a class,
                        just let the Program Director know ahead of time and a make up session can be arranged.

                    <p> We offer the first two weeks of classes absolutely free to new students. This gives you time to try the various classes and make sure you're in the right one, and discover first hand the true value of the program.

                    <p> Belt testing is different for each of our martial arts. Generally, rank progress from white belt to black belt- a process that takes between 3 years and 15 years depending on the art. For more information about belt testing in your
                        specific martial art, ask any of the GMA staff and they will be happy to help.

                    <p>Students line up at the beginning of class in order of rank. Someone with a black belt would be at the front right, while someone with a white belt or with no belt would be last (back left).
