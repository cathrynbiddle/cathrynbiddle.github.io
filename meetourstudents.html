                <br>At GMA we are proud to have a diverse student body. Families, men, women and children of all ages and ethnicities train together on mats. We have been fortunate to train people with both physical and mental disabilities, ranging from
                ADHD and Autism to stroke victims and wounded veterans. In every case, the GMA family has been a valuable tool that helps encourage the success of every student.
                <br>
                <br>Being a Black Belt means not being afraid to try. It means not being afraid to fail. It means not being afraid to work hard. I’m proud to be part of a school that has standards for its students.
                <br>-Morgan Williams
                <br>
                <br>I will use all the training I have received from Master Sieg and his entire staff to help me succeed in all my future endeavors because Tae Kwon Do has, more than anything, given me the will to succeed.
                <br> -Sabrina Chouinard
                <br>My wife and I began after watching our children from the observation area for a couple months. We watched the progression from Moo-goop to white belt and quickly to yellow belt. We decided rather than observing from the seats, that
                we had a unique experience to participate with our children in an organized sport.
                <br> -Ryan Spires
                <br>
                <br>I first came here when I was about 9, looking to do martial arts because I thought it looked cool. But once I began progressing through the ranks, I realized that martial arts is so much more than that. And now as a black- belt- to-be,
                I can say that the martial arts and the Gentry atmosphere have completely changed my life for the good.
                <br>-Karissa Cozee
                <br>
                <br>Gaining new friends in class like Jackson, Nate, and Donovan, has changed my personality by making me more mature and made me enjoy doing Tae Kwon Do and working with others. It has changed the way I deal with my anger and how to interact
                with others when they are bothering me. My focus was not really good prior to martial arts but since I started martial arts my grades in school have gotten better like from D’s and C’s to A’s and B’s. I now respect my teachers very highly
                like how I respect Master Sieg. I now respect my parents the same way as how I respect Master Sieg.

                <br>One resolution I have made over and over again was to exercise regularly. I have failed over and over again! This year I don't need to make that a resolution or goal. I have finally found an exercise I can stick with! I've been in
                classes at Gentry for a year and a half. Thanks Gentry!!
                <br> -Debbie Rahman
                <br>
                <br>I am glad that I found a traditional martial art school. One that teaches the simplicities of etiquette, the power of control, and that we should only use our martial knowledge for the good of ourselves and those around us.
                <br> -Eric Kachelmeyer
                <br>
                <br>As a child with A.D.H.D. and who still has some hyperactive tendencies, focusing on any one thing for extended periods of time has always been a challenge. However, thanks to the training and discipline received in the martial arts
                I have found a means to naturally better control these tendencies to a greater extent. This has helped tremendously boost my concentration in other aspects of my life as well…I would definitely be nowhere near the patient and collected
                individual I am now without these lessons disciplining my focus and concentration as provided by the martial arts.
                <br>-Tim West
                <br>
                <br>I feel more relaxed and confident in almost everything I do. If I were to meet myself from three years ago, I would see a totally different person. Upon comparison, I prefer the person that I have become.
                <br>-Qiming Deng
                <br>
                <br>I am happy to say that since I started coming to Gentry Martial Arts classes I have learned a lot about which battles are important and which ones I should not fight. For instance I started an exercise program of walking every day.
                No matter what comes up I do my exercise program. I do not always want to do it, but I find that when I do not retreat from the battle of laziness that I feel so much better. I have lost weight and now feel much better in so many ways.

                <br>
                <br>GMA programs are available to all age groups and can be more specifically catered to the individual goals of each student-- from the baby boomer wanting an interesting form of exercise, to the 30 year old woman who wants the peace
                of mind that comes from self-defense training, to the child with ADD whose doctor prescribed martial arts classes. Couple our instructors' expertise with a client intensive approach to service, and we believe GMA can provide a martial
                arts education superior to most competitors.
