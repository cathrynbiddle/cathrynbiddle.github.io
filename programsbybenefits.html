                    <b>Stickfighting</b>
                    <br> Benefits of stickfighting include self-defense and improved coordination.
                    <br>The Filipino martial arts (generic terms include Kali, Escrima, Arnis) have a strong tradition of effective fighting particularly with bladed weapons or sticks. Although the movements work well empty handed as well, these styles
                    are unique in that they put more emphasis on the weapons while training, which has many benefits beyond the self-defense applications and developing an appreciation and healthy respect of those weapons. Stickfighting is great for developing
                    hand eye coordination, better hand dexterity on both sides, reaction time, and sensitivity. The patterns and drills challenge the brain as well as the body. While excellent for law enforcement and those wanting effective self-defense
                    against weapons (used in a realistic manner), it also less athletic (no high kicks, no big falls, etc.) in some ways and might be a better fit for someone who can't move as well in the other classes. GMA teaches stickfighting as a
                    regularly occurring monthly workshop. (Our schedule is simply already too full). Our curriculum is not a particular style but rather generic concepts in the Dan Inosanto tradition through <a href="http://www.martialconcepts.com/">Martial Concepts</a>
